# Google Trends Analysis — Bitcoin vs Altcoins (2020–2025)

📊 This project visualizes historical **Google Trends** data for Bitcoin and Altcoins inside **TradingView** using custom Pine Script.

It shows how public interest (search volume) has changed over the past five years and makes it easy to overlay with price action.

## 🔧 Files Included

- `Bitcoin_Google_Trends_DateBased_PineScript_v6.txt`: Trend values for "Bitcoin"
- `Altcoin_Google_Trends_DateBased_PineScript_v6.txt`: Trend values for "Altcoin"

Each script uses weekly values normalized by Google Trends (0–100 scale), mapped to exact week/year using `weekofyear` and `year`.

- Studying **retail investor interest** over time
- Correlating **price pumps/dumps** with search demand
- Exploring **bull/bear market sentiment**
